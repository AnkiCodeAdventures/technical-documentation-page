        <p>
          The introduction should provide a high-level overview of the API,
          including its purpose and the problems it addresses. Describe the
          intended audience, which could include developers, product managers,
          or technical stakeholders. Mention the core functionality the API
          offers and any prerequisites for using the API, such as familiarity
          with specific technologies or systems.
        </p>
        <code>
          fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/users', { method: 'GET', headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN' } }) .then(response =>
          response.json()) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(error =>
          console.error('Error:', error));
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="authentication">
        <header>Authentication</header>
        <p>
          Authentication is critical to ensuring that only authorized users can
          access the API. This section should describe the methods of
          authentication supported by the API, such as API keys, OAuth tokens,
          or JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). Include instructions on how to obtain the
          necessary credentials, how to include them in API requests (e.g., in
          headers or query parameters), and any best practices for securing
          these credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          For APIs that support multiple authentication methods (e.g., API keys
          and OAuth tokens), you can include a comparison of these methods,
          highlighting when and why to use each. For instance, API keys might be
          more suitable for simple applications with low security requirements,
          while OAuth tokens are better for applications requiring granular
          permissions and user delegation. Additionally, discuss how to refresh
          tokens or rotate API keys for enhanced security.
        </p>
        <code>
          fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/resource', { method: 'GET', headers:
          { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' } }) .then(response =>
          response.json()) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(error =>
          console.error('Error:', error));

      <section class="main-section" id="base_url_and_versioning">
        <header>Base URL and Versioning</header>
        <p>
          This section outlines the base URL that clients should use to make
          requests to the API. If the API supports multiple versions, explain
          the versioning strategy here, such as including the version number in
          the URL (e.g., https://api.example.com/v1/) or using headers. Clarify
          how long older versions will be supported and how developers can
          migrate to newer versions.
        </p>
        <code>
          fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/products', { method: 'GET', headers:
          { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN' } }) .then(response =>
          response.json()) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(error =>
          console.error('Error:', error));
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="endpoints">
        <header>Endpoints</header>
        <p>
          The endpoints section is the heart of the API documentation. Each
          endpoint should be documented with its HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT,
          DELETE), the path, and a brief description of its functionality. For
          example, a GET request to /users might retrieve a list of users, while
          a POST request to /users could create a new user. Provide examples of
          request URLs and a description of what each endpoint does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with the basic description of each endpoint, you can include
          more complex use cases and scenarios that illustrate how different
          endpoints can be combined to perform more advanced operations. This
          could involve chaining multiple API calls or utilizing specific query
          parameters to filter or sort data. Consider adding best practices or
          tips on optimizing API usage, such as reducing the number of calls by
          using bulk operations where available.
        </p>
        <code>
          fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/products', { method: 'GET', headers:
          { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN' } }) .then(response =>
          response.json()) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(error =>
          console.error('Error:', error));
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="request_parameters">
        <header>Request Parameters</header>
        <p>
          This section should detail the parameters that can be passed with each
          API request. Differentiate between required and optional parameters,
          and explain their purpose, data type, and any validation rules (e.g.,
          maximum length, accepted formats). For example, a POST request to
          create a user might require a name parameter (string) and an email
          parameter (string), with the email parameter needing to be a valid
          email format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond listing the parameters, this section can delve into parameter
          encoding, especially for complex types like arrays, nested objects, or
          files. Include examples showing how to correctly format these
          parameters in different contexts, such as in URL query strings,
          request bodies, or headers. Additionally, provide guidelines on
          parameter validation, specifying what happens when invalid data is
          sent, and how to interpret the resulting error messages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="response_format">
        <header>Response Format</header>
        <p>
          The response format section describes the structure of the data
          returned by the API. Typically, responses are in JSON format, but
          other formats like XML or plain text may also be supported. Include
          examples of successful and unsuccessful responses, highlighting the
          key fields that will be returned. Explain any nested structures,
          arrays, or complex data types that may be part of the response.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, you might include information on how to handle large
          responses, such as pagination, filtering, and sorting mechanisms
          provided by the API. Explain any response headers that might provide
          additional metadata, such as total count, next page URLs, or rate
          limit status. If the API supports alternative response formats (e.g.,
          XML), provide details on how to request these formats and any
          differences in structure or content.
        </p>
        <code>
          fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/users', { method: 'GET', headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN' } }) .then(response => { if
          (!response.ok) { throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); }
          return response.json(); }) .then(data => console.log(data))
          .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="error_handling">
        <header>Error Handling</header>
        <p>
          This section should provide a comprehensive list of possible error
          codes and their meanings. For each error, describe the scenarios in
          which it might occur and how the client should handle it. Common HTTP
          status codes like 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found,
          and 500 Internal Server Error should be included, along with any
          custom error codes specific to the API. Provide examples of error
          messages and suggestions for resolving the errors.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="rate_limiting_and_throttling">
        <header>Rate Limiting and Throttling</header>
        <p>
          Rate limiting is used to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the
          number of requests a client can make within a given time period. This
          section should explain the limits in place, such as the maximum number
          of requests per minute or hour, and how the API indicates when a
          client is approaching or has exceeded these limits. Describe the
          response a client will receive if they are throttled, and provide best
          practices for handling these scenarios, such as implementing retry
          logic with exponential backoff.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="best_practices">
        <header>Best Practices</header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use pagination for endpoints that return large datasets to avoid
            performance issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cache responses for static or infrequently changing data to reduce
            API calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Validate and sanitize all input parameters before sending API
            requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor API usage to stay within rate limits and avoid throttling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regularly review and update API keys and tokens to maintain
            security.
